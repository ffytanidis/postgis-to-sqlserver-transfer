This task involves the process of extracting newly created geometries from the Maritime-assets PostgreSQL database, performing a series of quality control and validation steps, and subsequently uploading the cleaned geometries into the MarineTraffic (MT) staging SQL Server database environment.

The goal is to ensure that spatial data is consistent, accurate, and ready for further validation and testing activities on the staging environment, prior to production deployment.
